# Oppiz - The Phoenix Flavour

Oppiz is a refreshed, custom static site for Shadea/Phoenix's "The Phoenix Flavour", a Skyrim Special Edition modding guide with a focus on modularity. This is intended to replace the aging and limited Wordpress site that was used for previous editions of the guide.

## Progress

The site is able to render guide steps in an orderly fashion, though content has not been fully converted to use the new format. Layout & site design will need to be worked on, as well as a proper index/landing page.

Would like to implement a sidebar for the guide steps, as well as implement a FOMOD installation gallery. Plus would need to design for multiple modules.

That being said, this is most certainly possible.
