# Oppiz - The Phoenix Flavour

Oppiz is a refreshed, custom static site for Shadea/Phoenix's "The Phoenix Flavour", a Skyrim Special Edition modding guide with a focus on modularity. This is intended to replace the aging and limited Wordpress site that was used for previous editions of the guide.

## Progress

Currently none yet. This is just the Gatsby starter site at this point. First goal is to implement the Markdown generated pages - minimum viable product would be something that renders renders Phoenix's existing content w/o hiccups.
