# STEP 3 - THE CREATION KIT

Next we are going to install Bethesda’s official modding tool, the **Creation Kit**, or CK for short. It is important to note that – just like the game itself – the CK was updated for the 64bit engine and is now commonly referred to as CK 2.0 or CK64.

Additionally, it can no longer be acquired directly from Steam but must be downloaded via the Bethesda Launcher which in turn unfortunately requires a Bethesda account.

### 3.1 Download

- Go to [Bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net/en/dashboard), the official website.
- Scroll all the way down to the footer (bottom of the page). 
- Click the *Download* button in the **Bethesda Launcher** section.
- Double-click the downloaded executable.

### 3.2 Installation

- Let the executable guide you through the installation process.
- When that is done, you must log-in with your Beth.net account or register a new one.
- Once you’re logged in, you will see two CK icons in the left icon bar
- Make sure you select the **white** one (for Skyrim SE).
- The CK should be installed directly into your Skyrim SE **root** directory.
- Wait for the files to download.

### 3.3 Disable Auto Updates

To be able to better control when the Creation Kit updates, disable automatic updates.

- Go to *Game Options* and toggle off **Auto Update**.
- Close the Bethesda Launcher.

### 3.4 Roll Back To Previous Version

The author of CK Fixes (an essential mod for doing literally anything in the Creation Kit) has not updated their mod for the latest version of the CK (and does not intend to do so). For that reason we will stick with the previous version of the Creation Kit which still works with CK Fixes. 

- Download the executable of the previous version [here](https://mega.nz/#!mJ8i3IzL!GVxaRhXC7N85kHgMqCkirGPJBdy-mUGe-2WrLrNAuBc).
- Extract it into your root folder and overwrite.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> From now on, you can launch the CK directly from the root folder (or later via Mod Organizer 2).</p></div>

### 3.5 Custom INI

- Download this tweaked [Creation Kit Custom INI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19817) (the main file) <u>manually</u>.
- Extract it to your **root** folder.

### 3.6 Creation Kit Fixes

It's Bethesda, what did you expect?

- Download [SSE Creation Kit Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20061) (CK64 Fixes Release 2.x) <u>manually</u> from the Nexus
- Extract the contents of the archive into your **root** folder as well.

### 3.7 Unpack Scripts

- Navigate to your root folder and launch **CreationKit.exe** from there.
- After a moment you will be asked to unpack the **scripts.zip** (which contains all vanilla scripts).
- Click **Yes** to confirm.
- Once that is done you can close the Creation Kit again.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<p><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> While this is not strictly necessary if you don't plan to tinker with the scripts and their source, it does stop the CK from constantly asking you whether you want to unpack them.</p></div>
